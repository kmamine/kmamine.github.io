Thrilled to announce that our paper on **self-supervised scanpath prediction for painting images** has been published at a CVPR 2022 Workshop!

## The Paper

**"Self Supervised Scanpath Prediction Framework for Painting Images"** addresses a unique challenge: how do we predict where people look when viewing art, when collecting eye-tracking data for every painting style is impractical?

### The Challenge

Paintings present unique challenges for visual attention models:
- Diverse artistic styles and techniques
- Limited labeled eye-tracking data for artwork
- Different viewing patterns compared to natural images

### Our Approach

We developed a **self-supervised learning framework** that can learn to predict scanpaths without requiring extensive labeled data. This is particularly valuable for cultural heritage applications where data collection is expensive.

### Key Contributions

- Self-supervised pre-training strategy for scanpath prediction
- Domain-specific adaptations for artistic images
- Evaluation on painting datasets showing strong results

This work was a collaboration with colleagues from multiple institutions, and I'm grateful for the opportunity to present at CVPR, one of the top computer vision conferences.
